The purpose of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis on a provided data set. Your mission is to continue the investigation you began in C2 and perform further EDA on this data with the aim of learning more about the variables.

The goal is to clean data set and create a visualization. This activity has 4 parts:
  Part 1: Imports, links, and loading
  Part 2: Data Exploration and Data cleaning
  Part 3: Building visualizations
  Part 4: Evaluate and share results

  This will involve Taxi, Tiktok, and Waze datasets.

 1. Taxi Dataset:
You are the newest data professional in a fictional data consulting firm: Automatidata. The team is still early into the project, having only just completed an initial plan of action and some early Python coding work.

Luana Rodriquez, the senior data analyst at Automatidata, is pleased with the work you have already completed and requests your assistance with some EDA and data visualization work for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission project (New York City TLC) to get a general understanding of what taxi ridership looks like. The management team is asking for a Python notebook showing data structuring and cleaning, as well as any matplotlib/seaborn visualizations plotted to help understand the data. At the very least, include a box plot of the ride durations and some time series plots, like a breakdown by quarter or month.

Additionally, the management team has recently asked all EDA to include Tableau visualizations. For this taxi data, create a Tableau dashboard showing a New York City map of taxi/limo trips by month. Make sure it is easy to understand to someone who isn’t data savvy, and remember that the assistant director at the New York City TLC is a person with visual impairments.


  2. Tiktok dataset
Your TikTok data team is still in the early stages of their latest project. So far, you’ve completed a project proposal and used Python to inspect and organize the TikTok dataset.

Orion Rainier, a Data Scientist at TikTok, is pleased with the work you have already completed and is requesting your assistance with some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization. The management team asked to see a Python notebook showing data structuring and cleaning, as well as any matplotlib/seaborn visualizations plotted to help us understand the data. At the very least, include a graph comparing claim counts to opinion counts, as well as boxplots of the most important variables (like “video duration,” “video like count,” “video comment count,” and “video view count”) to check for outliers. Also, include a breakdown of “author ban status” counts.

Additionally, the management team has recently asked all EDA to include Tableau visualizations. Tableau visualizations are particularly helpful in status reports to the client and board members. For this data, create a Tableau dashboard showing a simple claims versus opinions count, as well as stacked bar charts of claims versus opinions for variables like video view counts, video like counts, video share counts, and video download counts. Make sure it is easy to understand to someone who isn’t data savvy, and remember that the assistant director is a person with visual impairments.

You also notice a follow-up email from the Data Science Lead, Willow Jaffey. Willow suggests including an executive summary of your analysis to share with teammates.


  3. Waze Project
Your team is still in the early stages of their user churn project. So far, you’ve completed a project proposal and used Python to inspect and organize Waze’s user data.

You check your inbox and notice a new message from Chidi Ga, your team’s Senior Data Analyst. Chidi is pleased with the work you have already completed and requests your assistance with exploratory data analysis (EDA) and further data visualization. Harriet Hadzic, Waze's Director of Data Analysis, will want to review a Python notebook that shows your data exploration and visualization.
